Here I have integrated Google map with MeasureTool.js and with Polylines
In MeasureTool.js there is a problem that we are unable to gerarete image for a map means lines are not preset on map image.

But with the help of polylines we can achieve to generate image on with distance measure lines.


Index.html page is based on MeasureTool.js
sample.html is based on Custom polylines with distance measure

You just need to put google map key in google map api
